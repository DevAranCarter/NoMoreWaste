## About the project ‚ÑπÔ∏è
The NoMoreWaste App is an app to help users save money and improve the lives of those without the money to  
afford food.  
  
We believe this app will greatly improve the lives of people in various countries and if it is used  
worldwide, it could help to prevent the food equality gap. If more wealthy users are able to give some  
of the food they do not use to others this would generate a new way of sharing food with the people  
around you.  
  
This app will allow users to log their food items onto the app and be warned about when their items  
will go out of date.  
  
Once users have been alerted of an expiring item they will be able to:  
1. Give their dry and tinned products to food banks  
2. Generate a recipe based on expiring items or any other items they may wish to use.  
3. Give their packaged food away on a free food marketplace when users are able to collect  
others unwanted foods before it goes out of date.  
  
## Future prospects ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
  
We have thought about multiple future prospect we could add such as:  
1. Generating points for users who use the app when giving away their food which in turn gives them  
discounts on things as an incentive.  
2. Working on a way to scan products only once to get information and expiry date.  
3. Create a network of users that can share their unwanted and unused food locally.  
4. Info about where food comes from and how it grows [can be used to teach/learn]  
5. Comes with tips on how to protect the environment after showing the carbon footprints it leaves, shows how to reduce it or other alternatives.  
6. To connect and work with supermarkets to further reduce food waste.
7. Micro job app, i.e. *gigwalk* see if you can get someone to collect whatever you have left over.
